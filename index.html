<br>                  
It’s Wednesday. In a few more minutes I’ll be seeing her again. 
<br><br>
Almost every week for the past 2 years and she stays over during holidays most times. I’m not sure I could afford to do this if she wasn’t so close by. I don’t often stop to think about her situation anymore, I don’t think there’s any reason to. She developed glaucoma in 2012, no it was before that, 2011, I think. I was out of the country at the time and she’d call me almost everyday to tell me her sight was going. We were always close like a regular mother and daughter, but I couldn’t really, I didn’t know in what way I could change things. 
<br><br>
Here it was, mom’s house. Well that’s not strictly true, but it’s where she spends most of her time. I prefer to call it a home rather than assisted living facility. Regency Park to be precise, she’s well taken care of and doesn’t complain much, when she does though I’ll be sure to know about it. The staff tell me they hear about it first, she’s not one to bite her tongue.
<br><br>
The woman at reception greets me, “Hi Claire.” I don’t believe I’ve seen her before but she knows my name.
<br><br>
“Hello, I’m scheduled to see my mother today, Tina Procter.”
<br><br>
She had a brief look of confusion on her face. “She should be here any moment.”
<br><br>
I think I may have met this woman before. She clearly knew who I was and was taken aback by my directness, probably interpreted my bluntness the wrong way.
<br><br>
One thing I love about this place is the smell. From the moment you set foot in the door you're hit with a strong odor of lavender. The children don’t like it and maybe it's a little strong but I find it relaxing. From the outside this place looks more like a rehabilitation clinic. There’s a large outdoor area, it’s so large we didn’t find Gavin for twenty minutes the last time we were here as a family. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a piece of trash in or around the premises. The building stands as a victory for businesses that operate as advertised. It’s comforting to know that her safety and wellbeing is not something to worry about, if there’s any issue they don’t hesitate to keep me in the loop.
<br><br>
“Here she comes now,” the woman said as she pointed at my mom walking through the entrance, the same doors I had entered.  
<br><br>
I looked back at the woman and she smiled at me, “You enjoy yourselves now.”
<br><br>
“Thank you”.
<br><br>
“Do you want to schedule anything specific between now and the next 4 months?”
<br><br>
Now I had the confused look on my face. “No. Thank you.” I don’t know why she asked me that but I’m not interested in inquiring further.
<br><br>
Mom said something to her aid and wiped her hands against her pants. She was wearing a beige cardigan over a light blue shirt, her short white hair was nicely groomed to gently lay over her forehead. I know she likes to present herself with the same meticulous attention to detail no matter what the situation. She could be sitting in her room the whole day and will still find an hour to make herself look good. It makes her happy.
<br><br>
“Hi Mom, don’t you look lovely today.” She coughed and then started to smirk. “Good morning Claire, what are we doing today?” I didn’t have the heart to tell her the truth, we’ve been putting it off for so long that it’s become a big thing. We embraced and I kissed her on the cheek. “We’ll go for a walk first and then we might get lunch.” 
<br><br>
She nodded her head and turned to leave, she may not have been blind for long but she was dealing it with really well. Better than I would. We took our time walking to the car and I could hear her breathing in the fresh air with her nose. Wasn’t she just outside? I saw her come in the front door. 
<br><br>
“What did you do this morning?”
<br><br>
“I had breakfast. I really like what they do with the eggs now, they taste better.”
<br><br>
“Did you ask them to do something different?”
<br><br>
“I did. I realized yesterday that I really like pepper. We have this pepper you can sprinkle on your food you see. I tried just a touch on my sandwich and let me tell you something, it was great. So I told Paula to put a little bit on my eggs and they have a really nice flavor now.”
<br><br>
I’ve always been cognisant of how she has gradually grown closer to this place. She used to say “The people there are nice.” That changed when I heard her tell an unimpressed grandson, “We have fun here.” Maybe his critique spurned her to take some ownership of the place. They have a personalized Wellness Program and they socialize all day so it’s not hard to see she likes living here.
<br><br>
I walked her to the passenger side of the car and let go of her hand. She doesn’t like when I help her to sit down but I always stand by and watch. “Did you clean the seats?” she asks. I could see her rummage under the seat with one hand as she held her body up with the other. It’s not often I forget to clean the car when I know we’ll be going somewhere. I sat in and turned on the ignition, “They're just crumbs ma.” 
<br><br>
“I hope you don’t allow the children to sit here.”
<br><br>
“They sit in the back like always.”
<br><br>
“Because I know Gavin won’t stop going on about sitting near the steering wheel.”
<br><br>
“He’s seven. He sits in the back like other seven year olds.” It’s odd for her to get presumptuous like that, she’s also not one to be passive aggressive. Maybe I’m reading her wrong, I need to relax.
<br><br>

                  <br>
The road south to Council Crest Park is a familiar one, it’s none too quiet but I can’t say it excites me much. A few weeks ago we were stuck in traffic due to a collision involving two cars. Nobody was hurt and there wasn’t really much to see, but mama wanted to know every last detail as we drove past the incident. That was such an exciting moment for her, she has a habit of grasping my thigh when we’re discussing something particularly important or thrilling, I think I had a big old bruise the following day. As a kid I never understood why adults were so interested in raw human tragedy, as an adult I still don’t understand it.
<br><br>
We talked about her friends at the home, she never has a bad thing to say about them but she often comments on how little some of them see their families. She told me how her friend requested a hairstylist and a photographer for a number of impromptu headshots. Supposedly she wanted them for her funeral when the time comes. That’s so disconcertingly morbid. I feel good knowing that I visit Mom regularly, it would feel ordinary if everyone’s priorities and values were the same but we don’t live in an ideal world. The satisfaction I feel at others' expense is regrettable, I can’t help it.
<br><br>
As we entered the park I told ma there was less cars here than usual and parked the car. “What does the sky look like?” she asked. “It’s not going to rain if that’s what you’re thinking.” I think I saw her quickly shake her head as she moved to open the door. “You should always have an umbrella in the car. I heard the weatherman say there would be rain this week.” We’ve had the ‘umbrella conversation’ many times before and it always plays out the same.
<br><br>
“You want an umbrella?” I asked her sarcastically as I retrieved one from under the seat. “Here’s an umbrella.” I lift her arm up from the waist and place the umbrella in her palm. “You ask every time about the weather, I don’t know why, I don’t. I mean it would be silly if you kept asking because we had no umbrellas a few months ago and it just so happened to rain. That was one time, and since then there’s always an umbrella in the car.” Maybe now she won’t ask in the future. She moved her head away from me and morosely said “Okay then.” I paused for a moment as if to consider apologizing but I don’t know what I was doing. 
<br><br>
“Here,” I said, as I put her arm through mine. The view from just beyond the treeline is stunning. A pocket of Portland and its many inhabitants visible from the natural vista that is nature’s periscope. People say it’s the best thing about the West Hills and I don’t disagree. It’s hard to tell the difference between a tourist and a local here sometimes. “Breathe in the air mama. It’s beautiful today.” She flares her nostrils and lets out a gasp of air. “That’s nice, healthy,” she said. “What have we got today?” This was her way of asking me to describe the view. She seems to be in a good mood, she usually is.
<br><br>
“I can see a plane far in the distance high above the mountain tops. There’s a lot of clouds and the sky is dark blue but the sun’s out.” The sun wasn’t really out, it was peering from beyond the thick clouds but I wanted to dispel any potential of a rainshower. I really hope it doesn’t rain. 
<br><br>
She grasped my arm a little tighter to motivate me, “What else do you see?” 
<br><br>
“Let’s get going now, it looks like there could be a few dogs around.” I could hear a reluctant groan. Walking in the park is nice but like everything done in repetition it's so boringly nonchalant. She doesn’t like Forest Park, and somehow believes Washington Park is this crazy hotbed for criminal activity. I mean, she’s half right, during the night it’s as suspect as any other park but during the day it’s perfectly fine. Walking around town can be a frustrating experience for a variety of practical reasons, we only go window shopping when we can afford it.
<br><br>
“Here comes one now.” A man with a small dog approaches us.
<br><br>
“What is it?”
<br><br>
“A German Shepherd I think.” I was never very good at identifying breeds of dog.
<br><br>
The man was already smiling before any interaction took place. “What a beautiful dog.” I exclaimed. The man was casually dressed in jeans and a clear black shirt, he was removing an earphone and placed his hand into his pocket to stop music playing, I assume. “Sure,” he said. Mom knelt down in an effort to rub the dog. “Male or female? I asked. “Female,” he replied. She was very friendly, basking in the open arms of Mom’s geniality. I know the children would love a little dog like her but there’s too many reasons not to get one. Nick and I have discussed it but it would just be an extra mouth to feed, we only have two children and don’t want a third, in any capacity. 
<br><br>
Our brief encounter was over when the man had slowly made enough distance from us and started to call his dog. He didn’t call it by name, just made clicking noises with his hands and mouth.
<br><br>
Mom just couldn’t resist, “What type of dog is she?
<br><br>
“Husky.”
<br><br>
It looked like a German Shepherd to me. Just as soon as the man had answered he was already putting the earphones back in and on his way. A man of few words and even less time evidently. “They’re gone now ma.”
<br><br>
The trees here are big and bushy, acting like a pleasant green canopy over those who stand in their shadows. I like to brush my hand against the bark and look up as we pass through. Much of the park is quite sparse with its vegetation the deeper you go, art installations and designated eating spots perturb the fiber of the overall area. Nature is a carefully considered blueprint here, you’re never too far from something deliberate.
<br><br>
Mom was quiet but that wasn’t unusual. We walk here twice a month and I think she just likes to embrace the tranquility of the outdoors on a grander scale than the backyard at home. I never find myself doing that, there’s too much to think about. Mortgage repayment, kids, mama and work. I wonder what she thinks about? 
<br><br>
“Anything on your mind?”
<br><br>
She scratches her nose a few times. “You should’ve got married here.”
<br><br>
This was new. “Like my cousin?” Before I could let her speak I remembered another cousin, “Daniel got married here too didn’t he?”
<br><br>
“Don’t you mind what other people did.”
<br><br>
“We got married in the same church you and daddy did. I don’t know why you’re saying something like that.”
<br><br>
“I’m just saying you could’ve had the wedding here. It’s a beautiful place.”
<br><br>
I don’t think that’s what she said but I let it go. Pictures of newlywed couples standing at the vista point are all too common around these parts, I think they display a certain lack of creativity.
<br><br>
We made our way back to the car  ignoring two dogs and not really talking much, nothing of substance anyway. I noticed her head facing my direction as we approached the door, eyes closed and arms still intersected with mine, “Hungry?” She quietly moved her mouth, “I’m having trouble sleeping, Claire.”
<br><br>
I rubbed her arm. “Did you ask for an Ambien?”
<br><br>
“They told me that would be an issue, the doctors told me that.”
<br><br>
“I know ma, I remember.”
<br><br>
“It’s always dark. When I open my eyes I can see a lighter shade of the darkness. It’s just enough to see something other than black. I get ready for bed, I lie down, but it’s the same feeling all the time. Night is morning and morning is night, I can’t tell the difference.”
<br><br>
I was overwhelmed when Mom got the diagnosis. They said it was manageable and there were measures to take to ensure she can live with it. One time, this wasn’t long before she started living at Regency Park, she called during the middle of the night to ask me what time it was, said she didn’t want to bother anyone by waking up early. Then there was the time Marie was born, she held her granddaughter in her arms as I described what she looked like. Why didn’t I have children in my thirties? I think about that all the time. I’m grateful she has lived so much of her life healthy and without any major problems.
<br><br>
“Ask them for an Ambien and you’ll be fine.”
<br><br>
“What'll That do?”
<br><br>
“It’s a pill, it’ll make you feel really drowsy and sleepy, I’ve had them before and they work.”
<br><br>
“Why would you need to take them?”
<br><br>
“When I was traveling to different countries the time of day was all over the place. It was night in France when it was just evening back home so something like that was a big help. Tell Paula what you told me, don’t think you’re inconveniencing them when you’re struggling to get sleep. Promise me that ma.”
<br><br>
She felt around the car door until she found the handle. “Okay then.”
<br><br>
We decided to get lunch at the Vista Springs Cafe. Mom likes the Focaccia bread they serve there and more importantly, it’s not too far away. As far as eateries go it’s not bad, you’ll mostly find it filled with young couples or small families, loudly trying to navigate an oversized pizza on an undersized table. That’s not hyperbole, it’s a fitting description for most places and here is no exception. We take a seat in the corner, closest to the window and further from anyone else. 
<br><br>
Mom was slowly scouting the surfaces of both the table and the seat with her hands, careful not to knock over the light or the salt nestled against the wall. Sometimes I’d rest my hands on hers to guide her touch when she wanted to feel something. I can’t help but be distracted by the veins in her hands every time she does this, dubiously climbing to the surface of her frail skin. 
<br><br>
It looked perfectly clean to me. “How is it?”
<br><br>
“Okay. Cold.”
<br><br>
A short, brunette haired waitress walked our way. “Hello there. Can I have your order?”
<br><br>
“I’ll have the Poppy seed Chicken Salad please and a glass of water.”
<br><br>
Mom shifted her hands from side to side on the table. “I'll also have a glass of water and pasta salad.”
<br><br>
The waitress, who mustn’t have been more than eighteen, quickly noted our requests and asked “We have different types of Pasta Salad ma’am.”
<br><br>
“You had the Potato last time.” I recalled.
<br><br>
Mom nodded. “Yes, Potato Salad.”
<br><br>
The girl waved the pen in front of us and held the notepad in place, “Homemade Potato Salad, Poppy seed Chicken Crunch Salad and two glasses of water. Do you want anything else?”
<br><br>
I could see mama shaking her head from the corner of my eye. “No thanks.”
<br><br>
“Great, I’ll be with you shortly with your food.”
<br><br>
The place isn’t that busy during lunch hours, a lot of people go to the nearby Farmer’s Market. I’d love to do that but mom hates the place. She thinks the food isn’t worth the hassle because it’s always too cold there. I’m not sure if that’s the truth, I think when people get to a certain age their critical thinking swiftly narrows many possible opinions down to one, or maybe she’s just stubborn.
<br><br>
She moved her hands closer to my side of the table, trying to find mine. “I need to use the bathroom.” Before we made our way there I found the waitress who was serving us. “Excuse me, we’re going to the restroom, can you make sure no one takes our seats?” She was in the process of carefully delivering plates to another table, “Oh sure.”
<br><br>
The bathroom’s here smell surprisingly nice. “Nobody here.” I said, before peering into the nearest stall. “This one’s clean. There’s enough paper towels and the ground’s dry.” She let go of my hand and felt the interior of the stall. I guided her to the toilet and left her alone. We have a system where she closes the door but doesn’t lock it, I wait outside the door until she exits or needs assistance. I vaguely remember her doing this with me when I was a kid. I wanted to be independant and do everything myself so she would stand outside the door. I was too small to lock it and she waited until I called her. I’m my mother’s daughter alright. 
<br><br>
We didn’t spend long eating our food, it was enjoyable but nothing special. They aim to please and rarely accomplish more than that, like most places. When you have kids you’ll soon learn to appreciate anywhere that displays a modicum of interest in preparing and presenting meals. You can have your fast food, I’ll gladly wait fifteen minutes.
<br><br>
It took us ten minutes to reach the car. “That wasn’t bad, right?” I wasn’t paying attention to whether she visually responded or not but she said nothing. “I have to go home and get something, is that alright?”
<br><br>
She presses her hands together and places them between her thighs. “What time is it?”
<br><br>
“12:48.”
<br><br>
A truck drives past the car and startles me. I feel like I’m in a trance. “I can turn on the heat if you’re cold.” She clears her throat and sharply looks to the sidewalk as if something caught her eye, “I’m not cold.” 
<br><br>
“Okay then, I don’t mind. I don’t have anything else to do today,” she says. Thank God for that, things were going to get complicated if she declined. 
<br><br>

                  <br>
We head eastbound to Laurelhurst. On the way there I tell mom what I see. Although I must say it’s easier when the kids are in the car, their way of illustrating life is distinctly more spirited than mine.
<br><br>
I’ve been on many business trips around the world and I almost always get asked about where I live. The pictures I have on my phone paint a sweet picture of the average suburban American family. I’m pretty sure they’ve all walked away with an exaggerated impression of life in this country. Most houses in Laurelhurst are Victorian in style while featuring all the modern amenities that come as standard in properties built in the last decade. It’s been described as vintage more than once, I prefer homely. It’s especially attractive this time of year.
<br><br>
I can see the clouds breaking. “Is there anyone at home?” She’s probably just making small talk but the question confuses me. “Nick’s still in Idaho and the children are at school.” I can see the driveway now. Looks like Mr. Holmes is cutting the grass. She might be able to smell it. 
<br><br>
She places her hands on her lap in anticipation of our arrival. I pull the car up to the garage and wait for Mr. Holmes to notice us, we wave at each other. He’s a good neighbor.
<br><br>
Now for the hard part.
<br><br>
“I’m going to the attic and I’m getting that box.” My hands were starting to sweat. “Now you can stay here or you can come inside but I’m going up there today.”
<br><br>
Her eyes were open, blinking slowly in rhythm. A few seconds pass, I open the car door with the hope of eliciting a response. The lawn mower was abruptly heard alternating in volume. I shut the door. 
<br><br>
“Just.” I slurred the word. “I know you want to do this. You promised me we would do it a few years ago and look at us now.” For some reason those words resonated with me and I started to get frustrated. ”It’s just a box of old things.” 
<br><br>
I immediately regretted saying that.
<br><br>
I put my hand on hers and clasped it, “I’m sorry mom I didn’t mean it like that. I didn’t mean to say that, I’m sorry.” She lay motionless, still facing towards the garage and still blinking slowly. The feeling of vulnerability was palpable, I felt like a child. Did I mess this up again?
<br><br>
When dad passed in ‘99 she put a collection of their belongings in a box. I didn’t know at the time but she had kept a number of items from her childhood in a similar manner while growing up. After the funeral she told me about it. That night we put pictures, letters, pieces of clothing, books, cards, medals and other small trinkets into a spacious Sony television cardboard box. TVs were fatter back then, I can’t imagine doing that today. This box was moved from her old house in Beaverton to mine when she moved to Regency Park. That’s when this whole thing started. I don’t know if she’s ever looked inside since we assembled it all those years ago. She would tell me there’s a right time to open it but that now wasn’t it. I brought it to her on dad’s anniversary last year but she got mad and told me to take it away. She said to never take it out of the attic again.
<br><br>
“Mom?”
<br><br>
She placed her other hand on top of mine and turned her head in my direction. Her eyes were glistening, water was forming at the base of her lower lash line.
<br><br>
She started laughing.
<br><br>
“Mom?” I said in a much lighter tone, I was trying not to laugh but if she could only see my smile. She gently moved my hand up and down. “You’re brave. Okay then, let’s go get it.”
<br><br>
“We’re doing it?”
<br><br>
She removed a tissue from her pocket and wiped her eyes. “We’re doing it.”
<br><br>
The sound of the lawn mower had ceased, as if to conveniently accentuate our mutual agreement. “One condition Claire,” I couldn’t anticipate what she was going to say. 
<br><br>
“Okay, and what’s that?“
<br><br>
She clutched my thigh. “I want to go up there.”
<br><br>
We have folding stairs leading to the attic, they don’t come fitted with a railing, I don’t even think that’s possible. I hesitantly conceded and we made our way inside. 
<br><br>
The house is as I left it. Gavin’s toys crowd the floor of the living room but I doubt we’ll be going in there. Printed pictures of the different cities I’ve been to line the wall leading up the stairs. They only serve to romanticize my youth as a management consultant. I spent most of the time staring into a laptop in the confines of airplane seats and the space they afford. It was more: I’m a second class citizen in your country and less House of Lies, although I must say the show’s title was apt. I could offer her something to drink or eat but we’ve just done both.
<br><br>
I stood behind her, one hand placed on her back as we ascended the stairs. She moved confidently, grasping the railing with one hand and lightly sweeping the wall with the other. “You’re a strong woman ma.”
<br><br>
She paused before reaching the final step and waved her in the air. “Oh stop it. Don’t patronize me Claire.”
<br><br>
“I’m not.” I wasn’t.
<br><br>
Marie’s bedroom is the first room visible as you climb to the second floor. There’s a bathroom and guest room close by. Gavin’s room lies adjacent to hers and our bedroom is next to his. I noticed the drapes in the bathroom were closed for some reason. The attic stairs were in close proximity to Gavin’s room. “Wait there, I’m just going to pull down the stairs.” I grabbed the string and retracted the ladder. My fingertips were sticky so I decided to wash my hands.
<br><br>
When I returned to the ladder I found mom standing in Nick's and my bedroom, her back resting against the open door. “Okay, ready to go?” She put her arms out to try and find me, I think I may have startled her. “I’m here ma, c’mon.” We stood before the ladder. I’m not sure how we’re going to safely do this.
<br><br>
She scratched her nose and readjusted her cardigan. “I want to sit down.” She motioned as if to sit on the ladder.

“Don’t sit there, I’ll go get you a chair.”
<br><br>
There wasn’t anything suitable for her to sit on in any of the rooms upstairs. I obtained one from the kitchen. The chair wasn’t very comfortable so I brought a cushion from the sofa. I placed it by the attic ladder and she didn’t delay in sitting down.
<br><br>
“Are you okay?”
<br><br>
She unbuttons her cardigan halfway and rests her hands on her legs. “My legs are tired.” I offer her a glass of water but she didn't want anything. I stood in silence across from her. “You and the children are all that matter to me. I don’t need to be reminded of the past anymore.” This was the first time she had said something like this. Intervention would often be fleeting anytime we’d approach something personal or emotional. “Memento Mori.” She smiled and closed her eyes. 
<br><br>
“What’s that mean?”
<br><br>
“It was a book. My favorite too. I must’ve re-read it hundreds of times throughout the years. A great mystery captivates the imagination.” She kneaded her pants. “The Girls of Slender Means was another I adored. That was the one to encourage me to write my own book.” The genuine complexion of excitement in her voice was electric. I placed my hand over my mouth, I was fighting back tears. “You wrote a book? You never told me that.” My voice was breaking, I’m not sure if she can tell.
<br><br>
“Wait until you hear this. I had a diary, now I don’t remember how I came into possession of it but I had no interest in using it like one let me tell you. I’d put the diary side by side with a book, then I’d copy lines from the book and change some of the words and characters' names.” We both burst into laughter. “Let me tell you something, I don’t have a creative bone in my body, you got that from your father.”
<br><br>
I can’t remember the last time I’ve heard her talk with such enthusiasm and determination before. 
<br><br>
She told me about the time dad unknowingly sold a car to Richard Dreyfuss, or at least someone claiming to be him. There’s a picture of them shaking hands.
<br><br>
She fondly described when they drove all the way from North Carolina to Kansas City in a Chrysler Cordoba when I was a baby. The car broke down twice. There’s pictures of that too, and a bunch of postcards they collected.
<br><br>
My grandparents, her parents, sent letters every month when they left the country. She recalls their sentiments so vividly.
<br><br>
We stayed there for two hours locked in hypnotic reminiscence. We laughed and we cried in a symphony of mixed emotions. She did most of the talking. I’m not a spiritual person but I’ve never felt so connected to someone my whole life, I’ve never experienced this, whatever this is before. In one of the most important moments of my life I saw behind the curtains, behind the personage. I know who she is.
<br><br>
She buttoned up her cardigan. I’d decided to sit at the edge of the ladder during our candid heart-to-heart. I stood up and began folding the ladder. We didn’t say a word. It was understood that this was the only correct way to proceed.
<br><br>
“I’ve forgotten a lot of things Claire, but I’ve never forgotten what’s inside that box.” 
<br><br>
I drove her back to Regency Park, back to where we embarked on this pilgrimage of sorts. I must collect the kids soon. I’ll see her again next week. Maybe we’ll do something different.
